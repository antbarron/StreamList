Management requests the ability for users to search and review movie information directly on another page. 
For this, your objective will be to integrate your React application with the TMDB API,
enabling users to search and display specific data within the application.
Furthermore, you will address a persistent issue in your application: 
upon page refresh, all information is lost, necessitating users to restart their interactions. 
To resolve this, you will implement functionality to store and retrieve data using localStorage, 
ensuring a seamless user experience across sessions.

In your program design submission,

Integrate your React application with an API to display retrieved information.
Utilize the TMDB API to establish a connection between your React application and the API.
Display the retrieved information from the TMDB API on a separate page under a different route.
It is up to you to decide what API information is displayed on the application.
Reconstruct your code for consistency.
Amend your code to ensure that all user events are stored in Local Storage to maintain consistency.
