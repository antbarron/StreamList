Now that you have created your React app in Week 1 and styled it to your liking, 
it is time to display the user events on the page and add more friendly icons to the app. 
For the icons, you may use one of the many free icon websites (like Google Fonts Links to an external site.)
where coders can download and utilize custom icons that can be used in your code.

Design the StreamList React program.
Display the userâ€™s event on the website.
Add more functionality to the webpage.
Remember that the more user-friendly it is, the better it will be for the user to experience the application.
For example, think of your favorite website, what makes it seamless, and why it is so popular.
Clear the user's event input once the submit button has been selected.
Install the fonts library from one of the many free icon websites (like Google Fonts Links to an external site.) where coders can download and utilize custom icons.
Program the Navigation system to have several options for the user to choose from.
Remember that these options must flow seamlessly.
