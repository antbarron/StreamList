The repository has the following structure:

assignment-1: This branch contains the initial setup and basic functionality of the StreamList. It serves as the starting point for the project.

assignment-2: This branch focused on enhancing the StreamList React program by displaying the userâ€™s input, clearing the event input after submission, integrating custom fonts and icons, and improving the navigation system with multiple user options.

assignment-3: This branch further developed the app by designing components to edit, delete, and complete events, using state variables to manage these actions in the React StreamList app.

assignment-4: This branch integrated the React application with the TMDB API to enable users to search and display movie information on a separate page, while implementing localStorage to persist user interactions and ensure data consistency across page refreshes.

assignment-5: This branch implements Google OAuth login and makes the StreamList app a PWA using the Chrome browser.
